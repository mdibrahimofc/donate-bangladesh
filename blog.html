                    What is the Document Object Model (DOM)?

                  <p class="bg-slate-200 text-xl">The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the structure of a webpage as a tree of objects, allowing developers to interact with and manipulate HTML and XML documents. Each element (like headings, paragraphs, images) on a webpage becomes a node in the DOM tree, which can be accessed and modified using JavaScript.</p>

                    How do you select an element from the DOM?

                  <p class="bg-slate-200 text-xl">
                    To select an element from the DOM, you can use different methods. getElementById() selects an element by its ID, while getElementsByClassName() and getElementsByTagName() target elements by class and tag, respectively. querySelector() selects the first element matching a CSS selector, and querySelectorAll() selects all matching elements. These methods allow dynamic interaction with the webpage.</p>

                    What is event delegation in the context of the DOM, and why is it useful?
                </div>
                <div class="collapse-content">
                  <p class="bg-slate-200 text-xl">Event delegation is a technique in the DOM where you attach a single event listener to a parent element to manage events triggered by its child elements. Instead of adding individual event listeners to each child, the event bubbles up to the parent, which can then determine the target of the event using properties like event.target. This is useful because it improves performance and simplifies code, especially when dealing with dynamically added elements or a large number of child elements. It reduces memory usage and ensures that newly created elements are automatically covered by the single listener.

                    How do you manipulate an element's attributes and styles using the DOM?
                </div>
                <div class="collapse-content">
                  <p  class="bg-slate-200 text-xl">You can manipulate an element's attributes and styles in the DOM using JavaScript. To modify attributes, use setAttribute() to change or add an attribute, getAttribute() to retrieve its value, and removeAttribute() to delete it. For styles, access the style property to directly modify inline CSS, like changing the background color or font size. You can also use classList methods such as add(), remove(), and toggle() to manage CSS classes dynamically. These techniques allow you to update an element's attributes and appearance efficiently.</p>
